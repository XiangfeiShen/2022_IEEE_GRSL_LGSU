Source code for the paper titled "Superpixel-guided Local Sparsity Prior for Hyperspectral Sparse Regression Unmixing" , IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (Accepted)

To response the questions about the code, we update the code of superpixel segmentation (see slic3DhsiNew.m), please replace the old with the new one.
